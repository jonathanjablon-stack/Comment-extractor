# Third-party notices

Comment Master distributes the following third-party software. This file records third-party terms only and does not grant a license to Comment Master itself.

The committed Pages runtime includes this notice at `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and the license files supplied by each package under `vendor/`. Source links below identify the corresponding upstream projects.

The Tesseract minified files refer to generated license notices. Those notices are deployed beside the files as `vendor/tesseract/tesseract.min.js.LICENSE.txt` and `vendor/tesseract/worker.min.js.LICENSE.txt`.

## PDF.js support assets

Comment Master distributes the following pinned assets from the PDF.js 6.3.289 package so PDFs render entirely from the same origin, including scanned pages encoded with JPEG 2000 or JBIG2. The complete upstream terms are deployed beside the assets.

| Asset | Upstream terms | Deployed terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adobe binary character maps | BSD-style 3-clause terms | `vendor/pdfjs/cmaps/LICENSE` |
| Foxit standard fonts | BSD-style 3-clause terms | `vendor/pdfjs/standard_fonts/LICENSE_FOXIT` |
| Liberation standard fonts | GPL-2.0 with the embedded-document and physical-product exceptions reproduced by upstream | `vendor/pdfjs/standard_fonts/LICENSE_LIBERATION` |
| ICC color profile | CC0-1.0 | `vendor/pdfjs/iccs/LICENSE` |
| OpenJPEG decoder | BSD-2-Clause | `vendor/pdfjs/wasm/LICENSE_OPENJPEG` |
| PDF.js OpenJPEG integration | BSD-2-Clause | `vendor/pdfjs/wasm/LICENSE_PDFJS_OPENJPEG` |
| PDFium JBIG2 decoder | BSD-style 3-clause and Apache-2.0 terms reproduced by upstream | `vendor/pdfjs/wasm/LICENSE_JBIG2` |
| PDF.js JBIG2 integration | Apache-2.0 | `vendor/pdfjs/wasm/LICENSE_PDFJS_JBIG2` |
| qcms color management | MIT | `vendor/pdfjs/wasm/LICENSE_QCMS` |
| PDF.js qcms integration | MIT | `vendor/pdfjs/wasm/LICENSE_PDFJS_QCMS` |

PDF.js also contains an optional QuickJS evaluation module. Comment Master disables PDF JavaScript evaluation and does not copy `quickjs-eval.js` or `quickjs-eval.wasm` into the production runtime.

## Components embedded in browser bundles

The published Mammoth.js browser bundle declares these embedded modules in its own license header: `@xmldom/xmldom` 0.8.6 (MIT), `base64-js` 1.5.1 (MIT), `bluebird` 3.4.7 (MIT), `buffer` 4.9.1 (MIT), `dingbat-to-unicode` 1.0.1 (BSD-2-Clause), `ieee754` 1.1.8 (BSD-3-Clause), `isarray` 1.0.0 (MIT), `jszip` 3.7.1 (MIT option), `lop` 0.4.2 (BSD-2-Clause), `option` 0.2.4 (BSD-2-Clause), `process` 0.11.9 (MIT), `underscore` 1.13.1 (MIT), and `xmlbuilder` 10.0.0 (MIT).

The JSZip browser bundle also contains Pako. Pako 1.0.11 is licensed under `(MIT AND Zlib)` and its supplied license is deployed as `vendor/jszip/pako-LICENSE`.

The pdf-lib bundle contains TypeScript helper code whose Apache-2.0 notice remains in the minified file. PDF.js and DOMPurify also retain their upstream license banners in the deployed modules.

## English trained data MIT notice

The `@tesseract.js-data/eng` 1.0.0 package metadata identifies Balearica as the author and declares the package license as MIT. The package does not include a separate license file. The MIT terms are reproduced here with that package attribution:
